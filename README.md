# What the project does and why it is useful
This is an AJAX application project which made using the REST API (thx rawg.io). This is a dynamic game-library, which have basic features like:
Pagination, Search-tool, content.

# AJAX application using the REST API
App is made using rawg.io api data, bootstrap 5, js, html and css.

# How users can get started with the project
This project was made for educational purposes only. So if you want, you can go and test this project on by clicking this link https://zealous-aryabhata-96c878.netlify.app/
However this link might not work (I have limited API/calls, only 20,000/month), and if so much people will use my personal API at same time, ofcourse it won't work. So that's why 
I suggest you to copy this code in your IDE, go to rawg.io and get your personal API-key. It will work 100%. After you setup your API-key and start using this code, you should know:

1) By clicking card-images you will get popup window, where you will find much more information about particular game.
2) If you are using search and you don't know how to return back to "mainpage", just clear your search.value (in webpage) and press enter.
3) Pagination should work perfectly, altough there might be some bugs.
3) This web-app is fully responcive and dynamic, data will change there automaticly.
4) Code is not ideal, and not that good due to 21 API-calls/page :( I might fix it maybe in future, but for now I am absolutely satisfied.
